# Practice

I primarily use this repository to keep up with code that I write to practice learning libraries, working on data science projects, and various other things I work on for personal use. Not all of the files in here may be complete, but I needed a place to keep up with the progress I make. 

Some of the files I've uploaded are fairly old. I wasn't always dilligent of keeping my GitHub up-to-date, but this is an attempt to compile my work over time.
